<h3>DASH - EVOLUTION</h3>
<p>We know <strong>cryptocurrencies</strong> can be confusing and hard to use for most people.</p>
<p>That's why we created <strong>Dash Evolution</strong>, the first cryptocurrency you can use on <strong>web and mobile</strong> without an intermediary.</p>
<p>Evolution enables <strong>seamless integration</strong> of Dash payments to any web-store or app in minutes without the need for complex infrastructure or centralized 3rd party services.</p>
<p>Users can <strong>pay friends and shop online</strong> as easily as they do with PayPal and Google Wallet <strong>without losing privacy and control</strong> of their money to a 3rd party.</p>
<p><strong>No additional software</strong> is needed and the service is <strong>100% free</strong>, <strong>open source</strong> and <strong>decentralized</strong>.</p>
